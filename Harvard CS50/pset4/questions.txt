0.  BMP is 32 bit color or over 4B colors, GIF is 8bit color or 256, JPEG and PNG are 24 bit color or 16MM
1.  A GIF file can be animated the other three cannot.
2.  lossy compression actually removes some of the data in the file.  
Lossless is just the opposite it compresses the file in a way that can be undone so that you move back and forth between the two formats without any loss of quality
3.  JPEG is lossy compression
4.  FAT = File allocation table, when a file is deleted on this system the data is removed but the file remains on the hard drive
5.  use a secure delete option 
6.  The stdint.h allows for the definition of exact size variables.  ie unit8_t is an 8 bit unsigned integer so this can store values from 0 to 255.
7.  These variables specify exactly how large the int value is in bits.  uint is an unsigned int only positive values are allowed, where int is both positive and negative integers
8.  in order: 1, 4, 4, 2.
9.  The first two bytes of a BMP file are BM to signify bitmap.
10. bfsize is the size of the bitmap, bisize is the ssize required by the structure.
11. if bisize is negative it indicates a top down DIP with an origin in the upper left corner
12. bibitcount specifies bits per pixel for color.
13. The oupput might be null if the computer does not have enough memory to create an ouptut file.
14. in combination with the sizeof function in the 2nd argument, the fread function reads in the full file (all bytes) 1 time.  The 1 represents the 1 time that the fread function reads the file.
15. size of RGB triple is 3 so 3 * 3 = 9 % 4 = 1  4 - 1 = 3 % 4 = 3 thus 3 is assigned to padding.
16. fseek is used ot change the offset of the file pointer.  in this particular code it is used to skip over the padding.
17. seek cur is used to set the location of the pointer to its current location
