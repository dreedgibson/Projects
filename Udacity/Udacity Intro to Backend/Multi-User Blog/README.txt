This is the multi-user blog project from Udacity.

This application can currently be viewed at:
https://ambient-union-156221.appspot.com/

However, in the event that I put another application in this spot, this can be run by downloading the google cloud sdk shell
and navigating to these files within that shell.  from there the command gcloud app deploy can be run and this application
can be viewed.

There are 10 template files that are used to create the website, and the python file Blogp1 is used to run all the backend
processes.

I am not as familiar with Javascript as I would like to be, thus further updates may include some fancier front end.
